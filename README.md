## WeatherPy
# For this analysis, over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator were analyzed to find relationships between latitude and the dependent variables Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed. The city data was split into Northern and Southern Hemisphere to compare the city samples and find negative and positive relationships. 
# All code in this analysis was from OpenWeather API documentation and course material.
# See analysis results in WeatherPy ipynb file.

## VacationPy
# For this analysis we are planning future vacations by utilizing the previous dataset, WeatherPy. geoViews and Geoapify API were used to create maps for qualitiative analysis to create parameters on cities with max temps of lower than 27 degree Celsius but higher than 21 degree Celsius. With wind speeds less than 4.5 m/s and minimum to no cloud cover. 
# From those filtered cities, we isolated the closet hotels within a 10,000 meter radius and plotted the results utilizing hvplot.
# All code in this analysis was from WeatherPy.csv, Geoapigy API and course material.
